#summary Introducing pandora-tray

=Introduction=
*PandoraTray* is a simple application that sits in your system tray and allows you to use your keyboards multimedia keys to control playback of Pandora One.

==Features==
*PandoraTray* currently supports the following keys:
  * 'Play' --> Plays or Pauses
  * 'Next' --> Skips to the next song

==To Do List==
  * Create a basic Windows installer
  * Double-click the tray icon to either launch Pandora One, or bring it to the foreground if it's already active.
  * Add the ability to detect if the PandoraTray application is already running, and not launch a second instance.

==Wish List==
  * Allow the user to map other keys

==Project Status==
This application is fresh out of the oven, so buyer beware, but I've been running it for a while without any issues.
